## Same distance simulation

# General Concept
A number of points is created, every point has a position x and y.
Each point chooses freely (randomly) two other points. Each point then has to achieve to be at a eqal distance from both other points.

# Implementation
After creation, a choosen number of points with partners
gets created and the best new position found,
so they find the lowest distance between them
